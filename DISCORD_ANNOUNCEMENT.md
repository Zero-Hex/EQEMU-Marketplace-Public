## 🎯 **Want to Buy (WTB) Orders**

### **What are WTB Orders?**
Post what you're looking for and let sellers come to you!

### **For Buyers:**
1. Go to marketplace website
2. Click **WTB** → **Create WTB Order**
3. Enter item name, quantity, and price you'll pay
4. Wait for sellers to fulfill your order
5. Get notified when items arrive!

### **For Sellers:**
When you hand an item to the Marketplace Broker:
- NPC automatically checks for WTB orders
- Shows you all active buy orders for that item
- Choose the best offer
- **Get paid INSTANTLY!** (no waiting for item to sell)

**Example:**
```
You say, 'Hail, Marketplace Broker'
[You hand the Broker a Mithril Breastplate]

Marketplace Broker says, 'Excellent news! I found buyers looking for Mithril Breastplate!'
Marketplace Broker says, '[1] Shadowknight wants 1 for 6000 pp each. Say 'fulfill 1' to accept.'
Marketplace Broker says, '[2] Paladin wants 1 for 5500 pp each. Say 'fulfill 2' to accept.'
Marketplace Broker says, 'Or say 'list normally' to list it on the marketplace instead.'

You say, 'fulfill 1'

Marketplace Broker says, 'Excellent! I've fulfilled the order for Shadowknight!'
Marketplace Broker says, 'You've been paid 6000 platinum!'
```

## 🔔 **Watchlist & Notifications**

Never miss the items you want!

### **Add Items to Watchlist:**
1. Go to **Watchlist** on marketplace website
2. Click **Add to Watchlist**
3. Enter item name and set criteria:
   - Max price you'll pay
   - Minimum stats (AC, HP, Mana, etc.)
4. Get notified when matching items are listed!

### **Notification Types:**
- 🔔 **Watchlist Match** - Item you're watching was listed
- 💰 **Item Sold** - Your listing sold
- ✅ **WTB Fulfilled** - Your WTB order was filled
- 🛍️ **WTB Match** - Someone listed an item you want
- ⏰ **Listing Expired** - Your listing expired

## 💎 **Bitcoin Integration (High-Value Items)**

For items priced over **1 Million Platinum**, the marketplace uses **Bitcoin** currency:

**Conversion:**
- 1 Bitcoin = 1,000,000 Platinum

**How it Works:**
- **Buying:** NPC automatically uses Bitcoin first for large purchases
  - Example: 2.5M pp item = 2 Bitcoin + 500K platinum
  - Excess Bitcoin refunded as platinum

- **Selling:** Earnings over 1M converted to Bitcoin
  - Sent via parcel system
  - Remaining platinum added to character

**Where Bitcoin Comes From:**
- Inventory items
- Alternate currency storage
- Both are checked and used automatically
